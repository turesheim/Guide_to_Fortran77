	<h1>Ad Notam</h1>
	<p>
		This book was converted from it's original source format which is LaTeX, then
		to HTML using <i>latex2html</i>. It was then processed with <i>tidy</i> and <i>sed</i>,
		then converted to EPUB using <i>Eclipse</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I came over this book when I was looking for a good source for doing Fortran
		77 development. But since the format was a little awkward and I've become a
		big fan of EPUB, I decided to use it as an example for the EPUB support I'm
		implementing for <i>Eclipse's</i> <i>Mylyn Docs</i>.
	</p>

		More information about this process can be found at the public Git repository
		hosted by GiHub. See <a
