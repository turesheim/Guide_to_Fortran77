"Dr. Clive Page's":http://www.star.le.ac.uk/~cgp/ book __Professional Programmer's Guide to Fortran 77__ 

This repository holds various scripts that I've used to convert the book from
LaText into HTML. Then assemble the generated items into an ePUB suitable for
a reading system such as an iPad or Nook. 

Feel free to download the "book":https://github.com/downloads/turesheim/Guide_to_Fortran77/prof77.epub and please report any issues with formatting etc.

The **epub** task used in the build script can be found in this repository:
